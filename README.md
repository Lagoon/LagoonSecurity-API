# Lagoon® Security RESTful API

Lagoon®Security can be integrated with any application capable of producing REST requests, no matter what technology, age, size and business area they have.
The REST API enables developers to access some of the core primitives of Lagoon®Security, which include Application information, Modules, Profiles, Environments and Users.
If you’re building an application that has many users, profiles and access control points, this API is for you!

With a few RESTful API calls you have the information you need to allow or deny actions like show, edit, delete and create for each resource. 
It’s very simple to learn, as only a few routes are necessary to obtain  data from Lagoon®Security.
